COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION PROMPT FOR AI RESUME ANALYZER PROJECT
================================================================================

You are a senior technical writer and engineer. Produce complete, professional 
documentation for the Python Streamlit project stored at 
d:\kitta\Ai-resume-analyzer-main (AI Resume Analyzer). 

Create the docs in markdown files and include exact commands, code snippets, 
configuration examples, and troubleshooting steps tailored for Windows PowerShell 
users. Be exhaustive — mention every important part of the project: purpose, 
features, architecture, dependencies, setup, running, database schema, key source 
files and functions, UI/theme notes, and common issues with fixes. 

Produce both an end-user README and developer-oriented reference docs. Use clear 
section headings, bullet lists, and code blocks. Ensure commands are PowerShell-
compatible. 

Where relevant, include safe best-practices (do not recommend committing secrets); 
give exact env var names to use instead of hard-coded credentials. Provide example 
`.env` and `docker-compose.yml` snippets. Also produce a short FAQ and a one-page 
project summary suitable for a project homepage.

================================================================================
REQUIREMENTS — INCLUDE ALL OF THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS AND CONTENT:
================================================================================

1) PROJECT SUMMARY (ONE PARAGRAPH + ONE-LINE ELEVATOR PITCH)
   - Project name, purpose, main features (file upload, resume parsing, skill 
     extraction, recommendations, scoring, feedback/admin UI).
   - Tech stack list (Python version, Streamlit, pyresparser, pdfminer, spaCy, 
     NLTK, Pillow, Plotly, MySQL).

2) QUICK START (END-USER)
   - Step-by-step commands to run locally on Windows PowerShell:
     * Create/activate virtualenv (show both Activate.ps1 and the .bat fallback).
     * Install requirements from App/requirements.txt.
     * Example PowerShell commands to run the app:
       ```powershell
       py -m venv .venv
       .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1         # or .\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
       pip install -r App\requirements.txt
       py -m streamlit run App\App.py --server.port 8503
       ```
   - Note on using py launcher and port flag; what to do if port in use.

3) INSTALLATION & ENVIRONMENT (DEVELOPER)
   - Environment prerequisites (Python 3.9.x as used, PowerShell details).
   - How to install and why spaCy model may be needed. Provide commands:
     ```powershell
     py -m pip install spacy
     py -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
     ```
   - How to fix common venv issues (broken venv referencing missing system 
     Python); how to recreate venv:
     ```powershell
     Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .venv
     py -m venv .venv
     .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     pip install -r App\requirements.txt
     ```

4) CONFIGURATION & SECRETS
   - Explain the app currently contains hard-coded DB credentials 
     (host='localhost', user='root', password='123456', database 'cv'). 
     Recommend replacing with env vars. Provide example .env:
     ```
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=root
     DB_PASSWORD=change_me
     DB_NAME=cv
     STREAMLIT_PORT=8503
     ```
   - Provide a minimal example.env and show how to load env vars in 
     App\App.py (example code using python-dotenv):
     ```python
     from dotenv import load_dotenv
     import os
     load_dotenv()
     DB_HOST = os.getenv("DB_HOST", "localhost")
     DB_USER = os.getenv("DB_USER", "root")
     DB_PASSWORD = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD", "")
     DB_NAME = os.getenv("DB_NAME", "cv")
     ```
   - Recommend never committing .env.

5) DATABASE SCHEMA & MIGRATIONS
   - Explicitly list the tables created in App.py:
     * CV database and tables user_data and user_feedback.
   - Provide the exact CREATE TABLE statements (copied from the file), explain 
     columns, types, and constraints.
   - Provide SQL snippet to manually create/inspect tables and a tip to connect 
     using MySQL Workbench.

6) FILE MAP & KEY COMPONENTS (FILE-BY-FILE)
   At minimum describe:
   
   a) App\App.py — main Streamlit app; explain sections:
      - Theme/CSS injection
      - add_bg_from_local function (currently disabled)
      - Header/logo SVG
      - Sidebar HTML
      - Upload/parse workflow
      - Database insertion functions insert_data/insertf_data
      - Admin screens
      - Feedback screens
      - Plotly charts
      - Resume parsing via pyresparser
   
   b) App\background.jpg — generated background image 
      (note: currently app uses CSS gradient; JPG is disabled).
   
   c) pyresparser\resume_parser.py and pyresparser\__init__.py 
      — resume parsing library usage and API.
   
   d) App\requirements.txt 
      — list of external libs (streamlit, pyresparser, pdfminer3, spacy, nltk, 
      pillow, plotly, etc.)
   
   e) passs — mention (credentials file) and security note if present.
   
   f) Uploaded_Resumes/ 
      — folder where uploaded resumes are stored.
   
   g) Logo/, screenshots/, admin/, feedback/, user/ 
      — quick note.
   
   For each file, include brief code pointers:
   - Where to change DB config
   - Where CSS is injected
   - Where to adjust theme.

7) ARCHITECTURE & DATA FLOW
   - Describe step-by-step flow when a user uploads a resume:
     * File is uploaded via st.file_uploader
     * Saved to Uploaded_Resumes/
     * ResumeParser is invoked to extract fields
     * pdf_reader reads text
     * Scoring logic runs
     * Recommendations chosen
     * UI cards displayed
     * insert_data writes to DB
   - Mention external services/libraries invoked (geocoder, Nominatim for 
     location, NLTK for stopwords, spaCy if used).

8) UI & THEMING
   - Describe the theme approach: 
     * CSS injection via st.markdown(..., unsafe_allow_html=True)
     * CSS variables (--primary-gold, --primary-blue, etc.)
     * github-card and github-header classes
     * Cloud animation
     * Logo SVG
   - Note that background.jpg is disabled; explain how to re-enable embedding 
     add_bg_from_local('background.jpg') and how to keep overlay for readability.
   - Give exact CSS variable names and recommended usages and an example snippet 
     to change gold to a different accent.

9) RUNNING & DEBUGGING
   - Commands to run app (PowerShell command shown earlier).
   - How to change port, kill running streamlit process, and fix port-in-use 
     errors (PowerShell commands used earlier).
   - Common errors and fixes:
     * venv Activate.ps1 blocked by execution policy 
       → show Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process 
       or use activate.bat.
     * spaCy model missing 
       → run py -m spacy download en_core_web_sm with same interpreter used to 
       run the app.
     * MySQL connection failure 
       → check service status, credentials, and port.
     * "No Python at ..." error when venv references removed system Python 
       → re-create venv.

10) TESTS & VALIDATION
    - If no tests exist, add recommended tests: 
      * Unit tests for parsing functions
      * Integration test for DB insert (using a test DB)
      * UI smoke tests (Selenium/Playwright)
    - Provide example pytest snippet and how to run tests:
      ```powershell
      pip install pytest
      pytest tests/
      ```

11) DEPLOYMENT
    - Provide two deployment patterns:
      * Docker-based (provide sample Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml using 
        MySQL service and streamlit command).
      * Heroku / cloud VM notes (expose port, use streamlit as web process).
    - Show sample docker-compose.yml snippet linking app and mysql with env vars.

12) SECURITY & PRIVACY
    - Note PII uploaded in resumes is sensitive. 
    - Recommend retention policy, how to delete Uploaded_Resumes/, and 
      anonymization options.
    - Suggest HTTPS (reverse proxy), environment secrets, and db user with 
      minimal privileges.

13) CONTRIBUTION GUIDE
    - Create CONTRIBUTING.md content: 
      * Code style
      * PR checklist
      * Commit message format
      * Environment setup
      * Tests required
    - Suggest labels and issues templates.

      recommendations.

15) FAQ AND TROUBLESHOOTING APPENDIX
    - Provide at least 10 Q&A covering typical user/developer questions and 
      solutions (e.g., how to change theme colors, re-enable JPG, increase file
